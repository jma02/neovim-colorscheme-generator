### <u>**_Persona 1:_** Google Engineer</u>
Who are they?
-  A software engineer at google who uses Neovim to write code.

What is their main goal?
- To easily create a custom Lua config file for thier Neovim environment.

What is their main barrier to acheiving this goal?
- They are very busy so they do not have the time to learn Lua and write a config file themselves. This engineer likely does not need much documentation about how to implement the config file into their Neovim environment so little documentation is needed.


### <u>**_Persona 2:_** Computer Science Student</u>
Who are they?
- A computer science student at the university of delaware

What is their main goal?
- To easily create a custom Lua config file for ther Neovim environment, an IDE their CISC 210 professor recommended to them.

What is their main barrier to acheiving this goal?
- They are very new to programming and busy with school work so learning Lua and making a config file would be very difficult and tedious. This student would likely benifit from good thorough documentation about how to implement their config file into their Neovim environment. This means we must include good documentation to account for all possible users.


### <u>**_Persona 3:_** Someone Learning Lua</u>
Who are they?
- An occasional Neovim user who is curious about Lua configurations 

What is their main goal?
- To easily create a custom Lua config file for their Neovim environment that they can use as a template.

What is their main barrier to acheiving this goal?
- They are new to Lua and a little lazy so they want a config file they can use as a template so they don't have to start one from scratch. This person will likely not need much documenation about how to implement their new config file.
